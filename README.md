<!-- Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/my/cli/project`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

Hello and thank you for checking out my Costa Rica Daily Surf Report gem.  I wrote this gem as my CLI project for the FlatIron Software Engineering Bootcamp program.  As I am an avid surfer and Costa Rica is one of my favorite surfing destinations, I thought it would be cool to have a Costa Rica Daily surf report gem.  This is my first computer program that I've ever written from scratch and it was a good learning experience for me.  The data from this comes from the MagicSeaweed website and uses Nokogiri to scrape the HTML / CSS data, therefore if data does not appear correctly, it may be because some of the HTML / CSS / links have changed since this gem was published.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'my-cli-project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install my-cli-project

## Usage

<!-- TODO: Write usage instructions here -->

Navigating through this gem is pretty straightforward.  Execute the gem by typing 'ruby command_line_interface.rb' from the terminal and then follow the menu prompts to view the daily surf reports (pulled from MagicSeaweed) for various surf spots located throughout Costa Rica.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
