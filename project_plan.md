Third level menu (Spot description)
Playa Santa Teresa in Golfo de Nicoya is an exposed beach break that usually has waves and can work at any time of the year. Offshore winds blow from the northeast. Groundswells more frequent than windswells and the ideal swell direction is from the west northwest. Waves at the beach break both left and right. Best around low tide. When it's working here, it can get crowded. Take care of the strong rips here.
